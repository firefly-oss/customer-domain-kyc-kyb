## Overview

`domain-customer-kyc-kyb` is the domain service responsible for all compliance due-diligence processes applied to Firefly customers. It handles two distinct compliance tracks: **KYC** (Know Your Customer) for natural persons and **KYB** (Know Your Business) for legal entities. The service exposes a reactive REST API and internally routes commands and queries through the Firefly CQRS framework (`fireflyframework-cqrs`).

The KYB track is the primary, fully implemented flow. It orchestrates a five-step distributed saga — `createKybCase → (submitCorporateDocuments ‖ registerUbos) → requestVerification → evaluateResult` — coordinating calls to the downstream `core-common-kycb-mgmt` service via a generated SDK. Every completed saga step publishes a domain event to Kafka, enabling downstream consumers (such as `exp-onboarding` or `core-lending`) to react to compliance outcomes without coupling directly to this service.

The KYC track exposes a full lifecycle API (open, attach evidence, mark docs complete, PEP/adverse-media recording, verify, fail, expire, renew) but its service implementation is a placeholder pending full development. Both tracks share a single Spring Boot application, a common infrastructure layer, and the same `KycbClientFactory` for connecting to the core platform.

---

## Architecture

The service follows a **CQRS + Saga** pattern layered across four runtime modules, with a fifth SDK module published for consumers.

```

The `KybWorkflowSaga` is declared with `@Saga(name = "kyb-workflow", layerConcurrency = 0)` and uses the Firefly orchestration engine to execute steps as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Steps 2 and 3 (`submitCorporateDocuments` and `registerUbos`) run in parallel within the same topology layer. Step 4 (`requestVerification`) is the join point that waits for both to complete before proceeding to the terminal step 5 (`evaluateResult`).

## Module Structure

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `domain-customer-kyc-kyb-interfaces` | Public request/response DTOs shared between the web layer and any consumer of the service's own SDK: `CreateKybCaseRequest`, `SubmitCorporateDocumentsRequest`, `RegisterUbosRequest`, `KybCaseResponse`, `KybResultResponse`. |
| `domain-customer-kyc-kyb-core` | All domain logic: CQRS command/query objects, command handlers, query handlers, the `KybWorkflowSaga`, `KybWorkflowConstants`, `KybWorkflowInput`, and the `KycService` interface with its stub implementation. |
| `domain-customer-kyc-kyb-infra` | Infrastructure adapters: `KycbClientFactory` (creates reactive API client beans for `core-common-kycb-mgmt`), `KycbClientConfigurationProperties`, the `KybVerificationPort` interface, `StubKybVerificationAdapter`, and `KybVerificationResult`. |
| `domain-customer-kyc-kyb-web` | Spring Boot application entry point (`CustomerDomainKycKybApplication`), `KybController`, `KycController`, and `application.yaml`. |
| `domain-customer-kyc-kyb-sdk` | OpenAPI-generated Java client SDK published for other services that need to call this service. Includes `KybApi`, `KycApi`, generated model classes, and a reactive `ApiClient`. |

## Domain Logic

### KYB Workflow Saga (`KybWorkflowSaga`)

The saga (`kyb-workflow`) orchestrates the end-to-end KYB compliance process as a DAG with `layerConcurrency = 0`, meaning the orchestration engine controls all concurrency within each topology layer.

**DAG topology:**

```
[Step 1: createKybCase]
      ├── [Step 2: submitCorporateDocuments]  ─┐
      └── [Step 3: registerUbos]              ─┴── [Step 4: requestVerification] ── [Step 5: evaluateResult]
```

Steps 2 and 3 run in parallel. Step 4 is the join point that waits for both. Step 5 is terminal and has no compensation.

**Step details:**

| Step ID | Method | Depends On | Compensation | Timeout | Retries | Event Published |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `createKybCase` | `createKybCase(KybWorkflowInput, ExecutionContext)` | — (root) | `cancelCase` | 30 s | 2 | `kyb.case.created` |
| `submitCorporateDocuments` | `submitCorporateDocuments(ExecutionContext)` | `createKybCase` | `deleteDocuments` | 60 s | 2 | `kyb.documents.submitted` |
| `registerUbos` | `registerUbos(ExecutionContext)` | `createKybCase` | `removeUbos` | 60 s | 2 | `kyb.ubos.registered` |
| `requestVerification` | `requestVerification(ExecutionContext)` | `submitCorporateDocuments`, `registerUbos` | `cancelVerification` | 90 s | 1 | `kyb.verification.requested` |
| `evaluateResult` | `evaluateResult(ExecutionContext)` | `requestVerification` | — (terminal) | 30 s | — | `kyb.verification.completed` |

**`ExecutionContext` key contract** (data written and read across steps):

| Key | Written by | Type | Description |
|-----|-----------|------|-------------|
| `caseId` | Step 1 | `UUID` | Created compliance case ID |
| `partyId` | Step 1 | `UUID` | Owning party ID |
| `documents` | Step 1 | `List<DocumentData>` | Corporate documents to upload |
| `ubos` | Step 1 | `List<UboData>` | UBO records to register |
| `documentIds` | Step 2 | `List<UUID>` | IDs of created corporate documents |
| `uboIds` | Step 3 | `List<UUID>` | IDs of created UBO records |
| `verificationId` | Step 4 | `UUID` | Created KYB verification ID |
| `verificationStatus` | Step 4 | `String` | `VERIFIED` or `REJECTED` |

**Compensation order (strict sequential, reverse):**

```
cancelVerification → removeUbos / deleteDocuments → cancelCase
```

**Step 5 outcome logic:** `evaluateResult` reads `verificationStatus` from context, maps `VERIFIED` to case status `VERIFIED` and any other value to `REJECTED`, then calls `ComplianceCasesApi.updateComplianceCase` to persist the final status before emitting the `kyb.verification.completed` event.

---

### KYB Command Handlers

**`CreateKybCaseHandler`**

Handles `CreateKybCaseCommand`. Calls `ComplianceCasesApi.createComplianceCase` to open a compliance case of type `KYB` with status `OPEN`, priority `MEDIUM`, a 30-day due date, the business name as the case summary, and the registration number as the case reference. Returns the generated `complianceCaseId`. Configured with a 30 s timeout, 2 retries, metrics, and tracing.

**`SubmitCorporateDocumentsHandler`**

Handles `SubmitCorporateDocumentsCommand`. Concurrently uploads each `DocumentData` item via `CorporateDocumentsApi.addCorporateDocument` using `Flux.flatMap` and collects the resulting IDs into a `SubmissionResult`. Configured with a 60 s timeout, 2 retries, metrics, and tracing.

**`RegisterUbosHandler`**

Handles `RegisterUbosCommand`. Concurrently registers each `UboData` item via `UboManagementApi.addUbo` using `Flux.flatMap` and collects the resulting IDs into a `SubmissionResult`. Configured with a 60 s timeout, 2 retries, metrics, and tracing.

**`RequestKybVerificationHandler`**

Handles `RequestKybVerificationCommand`. Delegates to `KybVerificationPort.verify(caseId)` to obtain an external verification result, then persists a `KybVerificationDTO` via `KybVerificationApi.createKybVerification`. Sets the next review date to one year from today and maps the provider outcome to `VERIFIED` or `REJECTED`. Returns the full `KybVerificationDTO` so the saga step can store the verification status and ID in context. Configured with a 60 s timeout, 1 retry, metrics, and tracing.

---

### KYB Query Handlers

**`GetKybCaseHandler`**

Handles `GetKybCaseQuery`. Calls `ComplianceCasesApi.getComplianceCase(caseId)` and returns a `ComplianceCaseDTO`. Results are cached for 5 minutes (`cacheTtl = 300`).

**`GetKybResultHandler`**

Handles `GetKybResultQuery`. Calls `KybVerificationApi.getKybVerification(partyId, verificationId)` and returns a `KybVerificationDTO`. Results are cached for 10 minutes (`cacheTtl = 600`) because verification outcomes are immutable once the `evaluateResult` step completes.

---

### KYB Verification Port

`KybVerificationPort` is a hexagonal-architecture port interface for integrating with external KYB verification providers such as Sumsub, Onfido, or Dow Jones. The only currently active implementation is `StubKybVerificationAdapter`, which simulates a 200 ms network delay and always returns `VERIFIED`. It activates when the property `integration.kyb-verification.provider` is set to `stub` or is absent entirely. A real provider implementation must be registered as a Spring `@Component` implementing the same port interface, with the stub suppressed by setting the property to the provider name.

### Downstream — services that consume this microservice

Downstream services use the `domain-customer-kyc-kyb-sdk` module to call this service over HTTP. Kafka consumers subscribed to the `domain-layer` topic can react to the following events without a direct HTTP dependency:

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `kyb.case.created` | A new KYB compliance case was opened |
| `kyb.documents.submitted` | Corporate documents were uploaded to a case |
| `kyb.ubos.registered` | UBOs were registered against a case |
| `kyb.verification.requested` | An external verification was triggered |
| `kyb.verification.completed` | The verification outcome was recorded and the case status updated |

Noted candidate downstream consumers include `exp-onboarding` and `core-lending`.
